Information Retrieval and Machine Learning techniques are increasingly used, especially on the web, to provide more relevant and personalized content. From targeted advertising (Google), to product suggestions (Amazon), or movie recommendations (IMDB), these techniques usually rely on a combination of large scale usage data mining, current page content, and personal history to adapt to each user. An interesting example is Google News, which attempts to organize the huge volume of daily news by automatically aggregating it on categories, and providing recommended articles based on the user's search history.

The aim of this project is to use similar techniques in building a web browser extension that suggests related web pages from history based on the current page. It builds on the idea of organizing and making data accessible by providing a context during generic browsing, helping to assimilate new knowledge, make connections, and find relevant information.
